# angular-dialogflow-chatbot

Open command prompt and navigate to the folder where you wish to create the application

Create a new Angular project
```
ng new angular-dialogflow-chatbot
```

Select 'y' when prompted if you want to add Routing into the application
Select 'SCSS' when prompted to select styling

Navigate into the project
```
cd angular-dialogflow-chatbot
```

Also open the code in the editor
Note: If you are using Visual Studio Code, simply type ```code.``` in the command prompt window.

Check if the boiler plate app works fine
```
ng serve
```
Once the code gets compiled, the below message should get printed on the command prompt
```
** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **
: Compiled successfully.
```
Open a browser window and type the URL ```http://localhost:4200/```. You should now be able to see the boilerplate angular app running.

We use bootstrap for styling in this application. Run the below command to add ng-bootstrap library into the project. 
```
ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
```

Remove the boilerplate code that was generated by default from ```app.component.html```. Only the below line of code should be present in this file
```
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

With this done, we are now ready to jump into implementing this application.
